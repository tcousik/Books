## About the project

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It allows users to manage a collection of books by creating, reading, updating, and deleting book records. Each book has a title, author, and year of publication.
